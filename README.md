# BCD-Complement-Calculator
In digital systems, understanding and implementing the concepts of complements (1's, 2's, 9's, 
and 10's) are crucial for various operations like subtraction, error detection, and data 
representation. However, manually calculating these complements can be complex and time
consuming. 
      To address this issue, we propose a circuit design  generates 1's, 2's, 9's, and 10's complements 
for a four-bit input. The circuit allows the user to select which complement they require, providing 
an efficient solution for complement generation. 
      The project utilizes concepts of digital logic design, including combinational logic circuits, 
binary arithmetic, and digital number systems. Specifically, it involves digital logic circuits for 
complement generation and multiplexing to select the desired output.
