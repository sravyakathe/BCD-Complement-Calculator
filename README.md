# BCD-Complement-Calculator
A digital circuit that generates 1's, 2's, 9's, and 10's complements for a 4-bit input. Users can select the desired complement using a multiplexer. The design leverages combinational logic, binary arithmetic, and number system concepts for efficient complement generation.
